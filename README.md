This code solves the fully nonlinear one-dimensional ac and dc Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations, accounting for mismatch is ionic mobility and valence of the ions. The ac version computes the **asymmetric rectified electric field (AREF)**.  

1D solution to the PNP equations for a binary electrolyte between parallel electrodes placed at z = 0 and z = H. The left electrode is powered with potential phi0 (dc and ac options are available.)

Most important parameters are given in userINPUT.m:

     (parameter) description  

     (phi0)     applied potential on the electrodes at z = 0 (kBT/e)
     (ac)       [0 for dc, 1 for ac]
     (freq)     frequency (Hz) [will be ignored for dc]
     (x_M)      electrolyte strength (M)
     (D1)       cation diffusivity (m^2/s)
     (D2)       anion diffusivity (m^2/s)
     (q1)       cation charge number (-)
     (q2)       anion charge number (-)
     (epsinf)   dielectric constant
     (H)        gap (m)
     (h_S)      thickness of the Stern layer (m)
     (epsRatio) Stern to diffuse layer permittivity ratio (-)

Other parameters are available in INPUT.m.

The ouputs are V_phi, V_n1, V_n2, E

    V_phi, V_n1, V_n2 are (PM, JM_f) matrices (cell centered nodes)  
    E is a (PM,JM_f+1) matrix (face centered nodes)

######## dc

For dc case, the simulation runs untill an equilibrium solution is achieved. 

The script dcPlot_E_n called in the end of the MAIN file (commented by default) plots the last rows of E, V_n1, V_n2.

######## ac

For ac case, the simulation runs for cn_max cycles of the applied potential until a harmonic solution is achieved.

The script acPlot_E_n called in the end of the MAIN file (commented by default) plots the time-average E (AREF), along with 3D plots for E, V_n1, V_n2.

Scalings of the raw output:

    V_n1, V_n2 are scaled by n_inf (number concentration of the electrolyte).  
    V_phi is scaled by kBT/e.  
    All lengths including z_f (vector cell centered nodes), z_e (vector of face centered nodes) are scaled by h=H/2.  
    Electric field is scaled by k_BT/eh.  

Output files will be stored in directory ../matResults/DIR/, where DIR is
